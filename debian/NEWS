liblist-someutils-perl (0.58-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From upstream Changes for 0.58:

  BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY

  - Fixed a number of bugs in the handling of empty lists. The any_u(),
    all_u(), none_u(), notall_u(), and one_u() functions returned an empty
    list in list context instead of undef. This is in direct opposition to
    the documentation which has always said that it returned undef. Note that
    the List::SomeUtils::XS code had the _correct_ behavior, so most users
    probably have never experienced this bug.
